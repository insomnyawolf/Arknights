# Arknights Remake

## Tldr

(Not abandoned yet)

I don't think i'm gonna get far on this as it seem's i can't get anything done in the end but if you want to ask something abouth what i learnt or what did i got working, go ahead, sorry for the ilusions i may have caused.

## Quick Idea

Rebuild the game from the sources that i found over [Saukiya/Arknights](https://github.com/Saukiya/Arknights).

Try replicating a concept character that i found about [Mostima Alter](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17u411f78c) <= It was love on first sight

## Status

Now it's a unity project once again (it doesn't compile nor work, nor is close to be ready)

## Notes

### 2022/03/18

I started working on this, for now what i've seen seems pretty clear and the person thet wrote it had awesome ideas.
For now i'll be cleaning things, refactoring parts of the code, translating comments, and reordering things as i thing they'll be more clear or not.

## Original readme translated
